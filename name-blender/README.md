# NameBlender

This app was created with Bootify.io - tips on working with the code [can be found here](https://bootify.io/next-steps/).
Feel free to contact us for further questions.

## Development

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be
added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options". Create your own
`application-local.yml` file to override settings for development.

Lombok must be supported by your IDE. For IntelliJ install the Lombok plugin and enable annotation processing -
[learn more](https://bootify.io/next-steps/spring-boot-with-lombok.html).

After starting the application it is accessible under `localhost:8080`.

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
gradlew clean build
```

Start your application with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./build/libs/name-blender-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```


```
gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=io.randomizer/name-blender
```
